- error handling
- can we do the text entry such that it checks each character & cancels if ESC is pressed? (+ Ctrl-C on Unix)
- can we allow left + right arrow keys? Or will that cause trouble with delete?
- can we update _thumbs.bin with a new image if we're adding & it doesn't exist?
- delete the record from _thumbs.bin when we remove?
- check a cart signature for Atari & PCE and see if I can generate it to check for conflicts. (Find unheadered ROMs?)
