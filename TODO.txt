- Better error handling? (Add a status bar to screens displaying last error?)
- Is the entry magic number really needed?
- Would `WriteAt` be useful? Probably not.
- What value does it save to the .sta file after it's been edited?
    - Doesn't seem to affect the association, so I assume it's using cart signature for that.
